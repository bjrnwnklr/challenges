This is an oldy but goldy problem. I set up a repo for it if someone wants to contribute. Otherwise just have fun

Find a number consisting of 9 digits in which each of the digits from 1 to 9 appears only once. This number must also satisfy these divisibility requirements:

The number should be divisible by 9.

If the rightmost digit is removed, the remaining number should be divisible by 8.

If the rightmost digit of the new number is removed, the remaining number should be divisible by 7.

And so on, until there's only one digit (which will necessarily be divisible by 1).
